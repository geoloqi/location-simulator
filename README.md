Location Simulator
==================

This script is a utility for debugging and testing Geoloqi applications. You can replay a Geoloqi history file
back into the API so that you can test the streaming API or geofencing with easily re-creatable data.

Usage
-----

First, you need a source file. You can get a source file by using the location/history API method.
See https://developers.geoloqi.com/api/location/history for documentation.

You can use the History tab on the Geoloqi website to preview your results before downloading. Visit
the website at https://geoloqi.com/map to see your history and find some data to download.
